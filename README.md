Todos
----------------------

The aim of this project is to help anyone learning about React + Redux by familiarising them with a small and digestible example codebase.  To achieve this, the codebase is incomplete and requires you to complete the remaining features.

The application is an implementation of the TodoMVC app used to demonstrate many Javascript frameworks / libs.  The application should allow a user to;
- enter in a new todo
- mark a todo as "completed"
- remove a todo.

Complete the todo list by implementing the following three features;

1) When a user clicks on the text of the todo item, the item will be marked as "completed" in the application's state (i.e. the Redux store) and will have the .todo--text-complete CSS class placed on the correct DOM node.

2) When a user clicks the X in the right hand side of a Todo item, that item will be removed from the list.

3) The Toolbar component at the top of the page is incomplete.  For this component, we need to display the current number of items currently listed in the Todo list.  This number should be placed in the far right hand side of the toolbar.  Complete this component and hook it into the Redux store to retrieve the required state.

Setup
----------------------

Fork this repository into your github profile, and start making changes to the codebase.

With the code now on your machine locally, install and start the development server with the following;

```
npm install
npm run start
```

The development server will pick up any changes you make on the fly and reload the page with your changes included.

After you have completed all the features in the challenge, please send a link to your forked repo to Curtis, Emily or Sethu.  If you have any questions at all about how you might complete one of the features, just reach out to us! :D

Happy coding!!
